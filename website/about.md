I started using the Power Platform when I was working as an architectural engineer. The Microsoft documentation was a good start, but all the content available online really helped me get better at building solutions. In August 2021 I switched career and started as a Power Platform Solution Architect. Quite soon I started thinking how I could do something for the community that helped me progress. In December 2021 I was playing [ADVENT OF CODE](https://adventofcode.com/) when the idea of a Power Platform Challenge website crossed my mind.
I discussed the idea with my colleague [DANIEL LASKEWITZ](https://twitter.com/laskewitz) who encouraged me to realize it.

The content for the challenges derive from work related development, newly introduced features that I test and your input. So if you have a good idea for a challenge, please post your idea on the designated [DISCUSSION BOARD](https://github.com/miguelverweij/PowerPlatformChallenge/discussions/2).
