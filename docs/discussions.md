If you don't just want to conduct the challenges but want to share your thoughts, get some help or any other sort of interaction, you can use the designated GitHub Discussions.
For each challenge there is a Discussion board. You can find those on the challenge pages.

If you want to share something in general about the Power Platform Challenge, you can use the General Discussion board.
