## Challenges

Here is all the sweetness. Each month a new challenge will be added.

## Before you start

It is highly recommended to enroll for the [MICROSOFT DEVELOPER PROGRAM](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program). You will get a sandbox tenant all for yourself. This means you will be the admin and can manage everything yourself. Basically all corporate tenants have restrictions for management purposes. By getting your own tenant you can execute all challenges without any limitations. You can obviously also use this newly created tenant for any other development ideas you have and want to realize.
