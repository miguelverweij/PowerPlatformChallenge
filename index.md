### Welcome

Good to see you here! The Power Platform Challenge is here so you can grow your skills on this amazing low-code platform.
Each month there will be a new challenge waiting for you. It ranges all over the Power Platform, so expect some challenges in areas you might not be familiar with, yet.

### Before you start
It is highly recommended to use a sandbox tenant for these challenges. This gives you all the control over your tenant and any restrictions due to an organization policy will not be limiting.
Just [join](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) the Microsoft Developer Program for free and all this sweetness will be yours.
