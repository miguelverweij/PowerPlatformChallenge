## Welcome
What a lovely surprise to see you here! The Power Platform Challenge is created for those interested in improving their low-code skills.

## Challenges
Each month I will share a new challenge. The challenges range all over the Power Platform. For some challenges we also use supporting software outside the Power Platform. All for you to get familiar with the wide range of tools and features that are helpful for you as a low-code developer.

## Discussions
For each challenge there is a seperate GitHub discussion board available. Here you can ask for guidance if needed, or share your approach on solving the challenge. 
For those who have an idea for a challenge, please share it in the [CHALLENGE IDEAS](https://github.com/miguelverweij/PowerPlatformChallenge/discussions/2) discussion board and maybe your idea will become a challenge.
