### Interaction

For each Challenge there is a dedicated discussion board. Here you can ask questions, share your solution for the challenge and brainstorm on how to implement what you've leanred.
The discussions are a GitHub feature, so you will be redirected to my repository. You can find the discussions through the following link:
